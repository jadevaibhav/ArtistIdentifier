Owing to space constraints (maximum size of the zip file that could be uploaded was 10 MB), we have deleted all the data files, trained models, and pickled data structures. Only the code, script and result files are present in the zip file uploaded. We are currently preparing dataset which would be uploaded on drive and link would be provided soon.
